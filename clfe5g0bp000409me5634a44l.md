When it comes to web development with Laravel, developers have the choice between using Eloquent ORM or Query Builder to interact with their database. Both techniques have their pros and cons, and choosing the right one can have a significant impact on the performance and scalability of the application. In this article, we will compare Eloquent ORM and Query Builder to help you choose the right technique for your project.

## Eloquent ORM

Eloquent ORM is Laravel's flagship database management system, providing an easy-to-use, expressive, and intuitive way to work with databases. It allows developers to map database tables to PHP classes and manipulate data through those classes. Eloquent ORM uses an object-oriented approach to database management, which can make it easier for developers to work with their data, particularly when working with relationships between tables.

Example of Insert Program using Eloquent ORM:

```php
$user = new User;
$user->name = 'Fajar Chan';
$user->email = 'fajar@fajar-dev.my.id';
$user->password = Hash::make('password');
$user->save();
```

## Query Builder

Query Builder is a Laravel feature that allows developers to construct database queries using a simple and intuitive syntax. Query Builder offers a more flexible approach to database management than Eloquent ORM, making it an ideal choice for developers who need to execute complex queries or work with large amounts of data.

Example of Insert Program using Query Builder:

```php
DB::table('users')->insert([
    'name' => 'Fajar Chan',
    'email' => 'fajar@fajar-dev.my.id',
    'password' => Hash::make('password')
]);
```

To help you choose between Eloquent ORM and Query Builder, let's take a closer look at their key features.

### Ease of Use

Eloquent ORM has a more user-friendly syntax than Query Builder, which makes it easier for developers to get started with database management. Eloquent ORM also offers a range of helpful features, such as automatic timestamp management and relationship management, which can make it easier for developers to work with their data. Query Builder, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve and requires developers to have a good understanding of SQL to use it effectively.

### Flexibility

Query Builder offers more flexibility than Eloquent ORM, allowing developers to execute complex queries or work with large amounts of data more easily. Query Builder is also highly customizable, allowing developers to fine-tune their queries to meet specific requirements. Eloquent ORM, on the other hand, has some limitations when it comes to complex queries or working with large amounts of data.

### Performance

Eloquent ORM can be faster than Query Builder when it comes to basic CRUD operations, as it uses a cache to store frequently accessed data. However, Query Builder can be faster than Eloquent ORM when working with complex queries or large datasets, as it allows developers to fine-tune their queries for optimal performance.

### Scalability

Eloquent ORM is a good choice for small to medium-sized projects, as it provides an intuitive way to manage data without the need for complex queries. However, for larger projects that require more complex queries or work with large amounts of data, Query Builder may be a better choice as it allows developers to fine-tune their queries for optimal performance.

## conclusion

choosing between Eloquent ORM and Query Builder depends on the specific needs of your project. If you're working on a small to medium-sized project that requires a simple and intuitive way to manage data, Eloquent ORM may be the right choice for you. If you're working on a larger project that requires complex queries or the ability to work with large amounts of data, Query Builder may be the better choice. Ultimately, the choice comes down to your specific requirements and preferences.
